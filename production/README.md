This is the folder where you put your real configuration into it.
Just copy everything from example/* to this folder.

This folder then looks like

 - production/configuration/hass/configuration.yaml
 - production/docker/docker-compose.yml
 
And so forth

All files in here are ignored by git, so you can still pull without issues
